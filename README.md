This repository contains the project files that are used to create a powerbi report (that analyses the significant strikes landed and takedown attempts from the UFC 305 Main Fight between Dricus Du Plessis and Israel Adesanya). There's a python file, that requests data from the UFC website; there's a powerbi file that contains the report and a csv fike that contains the transformed data.
